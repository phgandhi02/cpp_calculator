# Dev log

I am a little confused by how to implement this program since getting expressions is difficult due to the parentheses. The basic unit of such mathematical statements in the expression which takes some set of arguments and then returns a result which in this case is always singular.

I need to list out my assumptions for the project so that I can accomplish it in a reasonable period of time.

## Assumptions

1. Final result is a single number ie. no matrices, tensors, etc.
2. A function can take at most 3 arguments.
3. Parentheses can be used to specify order of operations.
4. All basic arithmetical operations much be supported for all real numbers within the limits of the long double type.
